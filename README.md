# Apple-Stock-Price-Predictor
*Machine Learning Project for predicting Apple stock price.*
## Project Overview
A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. This entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own.

Stock prices change everyday by market forces. By this we mean that share prices change because of supply and demand. If more people want to buy a stock (demand) than sell it (supply), then the price moves up and vice versa.Understanding supply and demand is easy. So, why do stock prices change? The best answer is that nobody really knows for sure. Some believe that it isn't possible to predict how stocks will change in price while others think that by drawing charts and looking at past price movements, you can determine when to buy and sell. The only thing we do know as a certainty is that stocks are volatile and can change in price extremely rapidly.

So the question arises can we actually predict stock prices with machine learning? This project utilizes Machine Learning model, Random Forest Regressor, to predict stock prices. I have used Scikit-learn to build a Radnom Forest Regressor model to predict stock prices using historical closing price.
